The Cascade

The aim of this task is to help you check your understanding of some of the values and units that we looked at in the lesson on The Cascade and Inheritance.

Task One

In this task, you need to use one of the special values we looked at in the Controlling inheritance section to write a declaration in a new rule that will reset the background color back to white, without using an actual color value.
